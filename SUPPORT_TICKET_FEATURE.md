# 🎫 Support Ticket Feature - Overview

## ✨ What's New

Your chatbot now has an **intelligent support ticket system**! When users ask questions outside your knowledge base, instead of just saying "contact an agent," the bot will:

1. **Collect customer information** (name, email, customer number)
2. **Ask for problem description**
3. **Summarize everything**  
4. **Send to your Telegram group** automatically

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow Example

```
User: "How do I reset my password?"
(Bot checks knowledge base... not found)

Bot: "I'd be happy to help you submit a support ticket to our team. 
     Let me collect some information.
     
     First, may I have your full name?"

User: "John Doe"

Bot: "Thank you, John Doe! Now, what's your email address?"

User: "john@example.com"

Bot: "Great! What's your customer number? (If you don't have one, just type 'N/A')"

User: "12345"

Bot: "Perfect! Now, please describe your problem in detail."

User: "I can't reset my password. The reset link isn't working."

Bot: "✅ Your support ticket has been submitted successfully!

     📋 Summary:
     • Name: John Doe
     • Email: john@example.com
     • Customer #: 12345
     • Problem: I can't reset my password. The reset link isn't working.
     
     Our support team has been notified and will contact you at 
     john@example.com within 24 hours."
```

### What Happens in Telegram

Your Telegram group receives:

```
🎫 NEW SUPPORT TICKET

👤 Customer Information:
• Name: John Doe
• Email: john@example.com
• Customer #: 12345

📝 Problem Description:
I can't reset my password. The reset link isn't working.

## 🚀 Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Telegram Bot

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Ticket Message Format

Edit `src/services/TelegramService.ts` (line 69):

```typescript
private formatTicketMessage(ticket: SupportTicket): string {
  return `
🎫 YOUR CUSTOM FORMAT HERE

Customer: ${ticket.name}
...
  `.trim();
}
```

### Change Support Response Time

Edit `src/services/SupportTicketService.ts` (line 140):

```typescript
Our support team... will contact you within 24 hours.
// Change to: "within 1 hour" or "on the next business day"
```

### Add More Questions

In `src/services/SupportTicketService.ts`, add new steps:

```typescript
export type TicketStep = 
  | 'idle' 
  | 'collect_name' 
  | 'collect_email' 
  | 'collect_customer_number'
  | 'collect_phone'  // ← Add this
  | 'collect_problem'
  | 'submitting'
  | 'completed';
```

### Validate Customer Numbers

Edit `collectCustomerNumber()` method:

```typescript
private collectCustomerNumber(customerNumber: string): string {
  // Add validation
  if (!/^\d{5}$/.test(customerNumber) && customerNumber !== 'N/A') {
    return "Customer number must be 5 digits or 'N/A'";
  }
  
  // Rest of code...
}
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- ✅ No data stored in database
- ✅ Sent directly to Telegram
- ✅ User controls what they share
- ✅ Can cancel anytime

### Telegram Security
- ✅ Bot token in `.env` (not committed)
- ✅ Private group (only team members see tickets)
- ✅ Can restrict bot permissions
- ✅ All messages encrypted by Telegram

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit `.env`** - Already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use private Telegram groups** - Don't make public
3. **Limit bot permissions** - Only "Send Messages" needed
4. **Monitor bot usage** - Check Telegram for suspicious activity
5. **Rotate tokens if compromised** - Get new token from BotFather

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Telegram not configured"
**Console shows:** `ℹ️ Telegram not configured. Support ticket system disabled.`

**Solution:**
- Add `VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `VITE_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to `.env`
- Restart app

### Issue: "Telegram connection test failed"
**Console shows:** `⚠️ Telegram connection test failed`

**Solutions:**
1. Check bot token is correct
2. Verify bot exists (search on Telegram)
3. Check for extra spaces in `.env`
4. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getMe`

### Issue: Tickets not appearing in group
**Solutions:**
1. Verify bot is in the group
2. Check chat ID is correct (should be negative for groups)
3. Make bot an admin
4. Send test message manually

### Issue: Bot starts ticket flow for everything
**Solution:**
- Knowledge base might not be loading
- Check Google Sheets API is working
- Increase relevance threshold in `ChatService.ts`
