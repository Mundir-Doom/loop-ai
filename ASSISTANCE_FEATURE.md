---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Before (Old Behavior)
```
User: "How do I reset my password?"
Bot: (checks knowledge base... not found)
     "I'd be happy to help you submit a support ticket to our team. 
      Let me collect some information.
      
      First, may I have your full name?"
```
**Problem:** Immediately asks for ticket without trying to help!

### After (New Behavior)
```
User: "How do I reset my password?"
Bot: (checks knowledge base... not found)
     🔍 ATTEMPT 1: Try to understand and guide
     "I'd love to help you with that! Could you tell me a bit more about 
      what's happening with your password? Are you getting an error message, 
      or is the reset link not working? 😊"

User: "The reset link isn't working"
Bot: (checks knowledge base... not found)
     🔍 ATTEMPT 2: Try different approach
     "I want to make sure I help you properly. Let me ask - have you checked 
      your spam folder for the reset email? Also, when you click the link, 
      what happens exactly?"

User: "It just says link expired"
Bot: (2 attempts done, now escalate)
     "I appreciate your patience! 😊
     
     I understand you've been asking about: 'It just says link expired'
     
     While I've tried my best to help, I think this matter would be better 
     handled by our specialized support team who can give you more detailed 
     assistance.
     
     Would you like me to create a support ticket for you? I'll collect some 
     quick information and make sure it gets to the right person. This way, 
     you'll get the expert help you need! 💙
     
     Let me collect some information to create your support ticket.
     
     First, may I have your full name?"
```

## 🔄 Complete Flow Examples

### Example 1: Resolved Before Ticket

```
User: "How do I update my profile?"

Bot: (Attempt 1)
     "I'd love to help you with that! Could you tell me a bit more about 
      what you're trying to update - is it your contact information, password, 
      or something else? 😊"

User: "My email address"

Bot: (checks knowledge base... found similar info!)
     "To update your email address, you can go to Account Settings > Profile. 
      From there, click on 'Edit Email' and follow the verification steps. 
      Is that what you're looking for?"

User: "Perfect, thanks!"

Bot: "You're very welcome! 😊 Happy to help!"
```
**Result:** Problem solved without ticket! ✅

### Example 2: Escalates After 2 Attempts

```
User: "The app is crashing"

Bot: (Attempt 1)
     "I'd love to help you with that! Could you tell me a bit more about 
      when the app crashes? Is it when you open it, or when you try to use 
      a specific feature? 😊"

User: "When I try to upload photos"

Bot: (Attempt 2)
     "Let me approach this differently - what device are you using? And have 
      you tried restarting the app or your device?"

User: "Yes I tried everything, still crashing"

Bot: (Escalate)
     "I appreciate your patience! 😊
     
     I understand you've been asking about: 'Yes I tried everything, still crashing'
     
     While I've tried my best to help, I think this matter would be better 
     handled by our specialized support team who can give you more detailed 
     assistance.
     
     Would you like me to create a support ticket for you?
     
     Let me collect some information to create your support ticket.
     
     First, may I have your full name?"
```
**Result:** Creates ticket with full context! ✅

## 🏗️ Architecture

### New Service: AssistanceService.ts

```typescript
AssistanceService
  ├─ shouldTryToHelp() → Check if under max attempts
  ├─ recordAttempt() → Track attempts
  ├─ generateHelpfulResponse() → AI generates helpful response
  ├─ getEscalationMessage() → Professional escalation message
  └─ reset() → Clear attempts when issue resolved
```

### Flow Logic

```
User Question
     ↓
Friendly Check? → Yes → Friendly Response ✅
     ↓ No
Knowledge Base? → Yes → Answer from KB ✅
     ↓ No
Attempt Count < 2? → Yes → Try to Help (Assistance Service)
     ↓ No
Escalate → Support Ticket Flow
```

---

## 🎯 Attempt Counter System

### Tracking
- **Max Attempts:** 2 (configurable)
- **Counter resets when:**
  - Query answered from knowledge base
  - Support ticket created
  - User says thanks/goodbye
  
### Context Preservation
- Stores previous queries
- Passes context to AI for better understanding
- Includes in escalation message

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Number of Attempts

Edit `src/services/AssistanceService.ts`:

```typescript
private maxAttempts: number = 2;  // Change to 1, 3, or more
```

**Recommendations:**
- **1 attempt:** Faster escalation, less helpful
- **2 attempts:** Balanced (current)
- **3 attempts:** More patient, might frustrate users

### Customize Response Style

Edit `src/services/AssistanceService.ts` in `buildSystemPrompt()`:

```typescript
// Attempt 1 prompt
return `You are a helpful customer service assistant...
Your tone: [Add your brand voice here]
Your focus: [Add specific guidance]`;
```

### Customize Escalation Message

Edit `getEscalationMessage()`:

```typescript
return `Your custom escalation message here...
Would you like me to create a support ticket for you?`;
```
