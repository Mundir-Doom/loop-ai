# Debug: Why "What are your business hours?" didn't work

## Issue
The question should be answered from Google Sheets but instead went through assistance attempts.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Made Messages Shorter âœ…
**Before:**
"I appreciate your patience! ðŸ˜Š I understand you've been asking about..."
(Very long message)

**After:**
"I'll connect you with our support team for specialized help."
(Short and direct)

### 2. Improved Relevance Checking âœ…
**Changes:**
- Lowered threshold from 40% to 30%
- Made relevance checker MORE generous (if ANY connection exists, mark as relevant)
- Improved context search with scoring system
- Better phrase matching

### 3. Better Context Search âœ…
**New scoring system:**
- Exact phrase match: +100 points
- Individual word match: +10 points each
- Returns top 5 most relevant rows

## Test Now

Try these questions that SHOULD be answered:
- "What are your business hours?"
- "When are you open?"
- "What time do you close?"

The bot should now find these in your Google Sheets!

## Debug Steps if Still Not Working

1. Check console logs for:
   - "âœ… Services initialized successfully"
   - "ðŸ“Š Knowledge Base: X entries..."

2. Open browser DevTools and check:
   - Is the sheet data loading?
   - What does the relevance check return?

3. Verify your Google Sheet has:
   - First row: Headers (Question, Answer, etc.)
   - Data starting from row 2
   - An entry like: "What are your business hours?" | "We're open Mon-Fri 9am-5pm"
